create a new folder to take course notes in markdown .md files, if you donâ€™t already have one, outside of any existing git repository (check with git status)
go inside:
create a new file git-notes.md with some of your notes
run git init to turn your folder into a git repository
ask git to track your file git-notes.md
commit your work
add some more notes / links
commit these new changes
add something silly: like remove 1 or 2 lines, as if accidentally (and save).
make sure you had committed your work before saving these mistakes.
undo these mistakes using git
